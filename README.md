# RSA & PQC-Based Aadhaar Authentication

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **Secure Aadhaar Authentication System** using **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)**. It enhances traditional RSA-based authentication with **quantum-resistant** digital signatures to future-proof the system against quantum attacks.

## 🛠 Features
- **Quantum-Secure Digital Signatures**: Implements post-quantum cryptographic signatures.
- **Aadhaar Authentication**: Securely verifies Aadhaar credentials.
- **Simulated Environment**: Runs on standard Python libraries, no quantum hardware required.
- **Performance Comparision**: Compares both RSA and PQC-based algorithms.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- liboqs-python
- oqs
- cryptography
- signxml

## 🏆 Future Improvements
- Implement **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** for enhanced security.
- Optimize performance for large-scale authentication systems.
- Integrate with **biometric authentication** for multi-factor security.
